## Part 2: HTTP Methods Testing Tools

### Initial Issue
User reported that `http-analyzer.py` was failing with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'" when run in the container.

### Problem Diagnosis
1. **Missing Python Dependencies**: The `requests` module wasn't installed in the container
2. **Requirements Path Issue**: The `requirements.txt` file wasn't in the `/scripts/` directory where the container expected it
3. **Network Connectivity**: Practice container wasn't connected to HTTP servers network

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Python Dependencies
```bash
# Copied requirements.txt to scripts directory
cp requirements.txt scripts/requirements.txt

# Rebuilt container to install dependencies
docker compose up --build -d net-practice

# Manually installed requests module
docker exec net-practice pip3 install requests
```

#### 2. Fixed Network Connectivity
```bash
# Connected practice container to HTTP servers network
docker network connect 06-http-servers_http-network net-practice
```

#### 3. Created Advanced HTTP Methods Testing Tool
**New Tool**: `scripts/http-methods-test.py`
- **Features**:
  - Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE)
  - Support for JSON data, form data, query parameters
  - Custom headers support
  - Detailed response analysis
  - Error handling and debugging

**Key Improvements**:
- Handles both JSON objects and plain text data
- Proper JSON data formatting in requests
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed output with response analysis

#### 4. Created Comprehensive Documentation
**New File**: `modules/02-protocols/http-https/http-methods-guide.md`
- Command examples for all HTTP methods
- Data format explanations (JSON, form, query params)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Learning exercises
- Tool comparison

### Testing Results
Successfully tested with `httpbingo.org`:
- **POST with JSON**: ✅ 200 OK
- **POST with form data**: ✅ 200 OK  
- **GET with query params**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Proper Content-Type headers**: ✅ Auto-detected

### Files Created/Modified
1. **`scripts/http-methods-test.py`** - Advanced HTTP methods testing tool
2. **`modules/02-protocols/http-https/http-methods-test.py`** - Symbolic link
3. **`modules/02-protocols/http-https/http-methods-guide.md`** - Comprehensive guide
4. **`scripts/requirements.txt`** - Copied from root directory
5. **`modules/02-protocols/ssh/README.md`** - Massively expanded
