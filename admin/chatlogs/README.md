## Creating New Chatlogs

When creating a new chatlog:

1. **Use Consistent Naming**: `development-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Include All Sections**: Follow the established format
3. **Document Context**: Include current project state and structure
4. **Technical Details**: Document specific implementations and decisions
5. **Future Planning**: Include next steps and priorities

## Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Update chatlogs after significant development sessions
- **Archival**: Move old chatlogs to archive subdirectory if needed
- **Index**: Maintain this README with current chatlog information
- **Context**: Ensure each chatlog provides sufficient context for future reference
