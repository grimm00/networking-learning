## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### One-Command Installation
**Cross-platform installation script:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/networking-learning.git
cd networking-learning

# Run automated installation
./install.sh
```

### Containerized Practice (Recommended)
**Perfect for safe learning during meetings or training sessions!**

```bash
# Start the networking practice environment
./container-practice.sh start

# Enter practice container
./container-practice.sh enter

# Run practice exercises
./container-practice.sh exercises
```

**Why Use Containers?**
- âœ… **Safe Environment**: Practice without affecting your host system
- âœ… **Meeting-Safe**: Learn during Zoom sessions without risk
- âœ… **Easy Reset**: Just restart containers to clean state
- âœ… **Full Tools**: All networking tools pre-installed
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Local Development Setup
**For development and local testing:**

```bash
# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Or manually install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**System Requirements:**
- **Python**: 3.8+ with pip
- **Memory**: 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB free space
- **Network**: Internet connection for package downloads
- **Platform**: macOS 10.15+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), Windows 10+ (WSL2)

### Platform-Specific Installation

#### macOS
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip docker.io docker-compose

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-username/networking-learning.git
cd networking-learning
./install.sh
```

#### Windows (WSL2)
```bash
# Install WSL2
wsl --install

# In WSL2 Ubuntu terminal:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip docker.io docker-compose

# Clone and setup
